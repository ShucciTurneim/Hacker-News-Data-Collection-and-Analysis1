Steve was asking designers to see it as such (and not as a threat to their traditional tools and value vectors).<p>We in society are trapped by the things we need to live at this scale and level of coordination.  At a minimum, don&#x27;t be evil.  But that&#x27;s not all.<p>In 2024, the situation has reversed: generations have become conditioned by the attention economy, to the point that everyone - small children to our best tech leaders - are making sound-bite reactive emotional decisions shaping our future.<p>Tech affords not just the opportunity to influence.  It&#x27;s realizing that other people made your capabilities and everything you depend on, and you&#x27;re responsible for doing the same, to make it possible for future people to live a good life.<p>I think SJ took it as a responsibility instead of an opportunity because as an adopted person he directly experienced the contingency of nuture and appreciation for the people who did raise him.<p>&quot;the ability to put something back into that pool of human experiences is extremely neat&quot; - SJ, remembered by Jony Ives",40995515,"19922 days, 21:07:34"

I try to emulate that Jobs-ian style at work and a lot of people seem to like my presentations.<p>I think people really like it when someone takes the responsibility of standing up and saying &quot;let&#x27;s not overcomplicate this, I&#x27;ll take responsibility for making the decisions and I don&#x27;t spend a lot of time trying to hide my real level of knowledge. In fact, I may know less than some of you.&quot; (Even if that&#x27;s probably not true.)<p>Another good (albeit hyperbolic) example of this is Jeremy Irons&#x27; speech near the end of Margin Call (2011) where he tells the junior analyst to &quot;speak to me as if I am a very small child, or possibly a golden retriever.&quot; In fact, that&#x27;s also an explicit direction given to flight controllers at NASA during their training.",40995515,"19922 days, 18:36:56"

41000188,Scaevolus,"Aside: bisecting flakes doesn&#x27;t <i>have</i> to involve repeated runs. You can reformulate bisection as an information probing operation, expanding the scope to support noisy benchmarks or low-probability flakes. Bayesian inference narrows down the probable range of the failure for each new observation, and you can choose new probes to maximize information gain-- or even run them in parallel to minimize the total time.<p>You <i>do</i> have to provide flake rate probability to do the probability estimates, but even roughly correct rates work fine. Running bisects assuming a 5% chance of getting a false positive or negative barely adds more steps and greatly improves robustness.<p>The math is pretty simple too-- my old prototype might still be in Google&#x27;s monorepo; I should reimplement it for the open source world.",40995982,"19922 days, 22:04:22"
